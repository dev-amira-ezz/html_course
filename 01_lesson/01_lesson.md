## HTML Definition

- **HTML**Â (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
- "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
- HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. [[1](#1-mdn-html)]

## Elements and Tags

An element consists of an opening tag, content and an ending tag.

```html
<opening_tag>Content</closing_tag>
```

For example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## Live Server URL

- The following is the URL of the page opened by live server
`http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`
- The URL `http://127.0.0.1` refers to the local server.
- The `5500` at the end of the URL is the port number.
While `index.html` is the path to the HTML file.

## Language Codes

- A `lang` attribute should be added to the `html` element indicating the language of the web page.
- A full list of ISO language codes used in the `lang` attribute is on the w3schools website. [[2]](#2-html-language-codes-list)

## Tips

- Keep file names in lower case with no space, separating words by hyphens.
- Only use one `h1` element per page.
- Always use W3C validator to check for any errors on your web page.
- Don't use double dashes inside an HTML comment.
- To resolve the "Trailing Slash of Void Elements" warning from the W3C validator for all the projects on your computer, assuming you're using Linux, perform these steps:
  - create a file with the name: ~/.prettierrc
  - In VSCode, click CTRL + , to open settings.
  - Search for prettier.
  - Under "Prettier: Config Path", write" ~/.prettierrc
  - Open the ~/.prettierrc and enter the following and then save the file:

```
{
  "htmlWhitespaceSensitivity": "ignore"
}
```
